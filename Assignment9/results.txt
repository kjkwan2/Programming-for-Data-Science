The boxplots from 2007 through 2012 reveal no significant changes, which may be partially explained by the 2007 Great Recession. From 2007-2012, Europe is the region with the highest average GDP per capita, while Africa is the region with the lowest GDP per capita. From 2007-2012, Asia is the region with the largest range of GDP per capita. 

The histograms show that in general, each region's countries have increasing GDP per capita. However, over the five year period of 2007-2012, these changes are not significant enough to be captured in the regional distributions of GDP per capita, as previously stated in the observation of the boxplots.
